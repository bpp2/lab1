-Declared integers n,i
-Declared aswell count by initializing 0
-Gave an integer input using scanf and assinged it to variable n
-Ran a loop using variable i where the initialization is given as 1 
-Gave condition as i<=n and an increment i++
-Gave conditional statements to check whether the given number gives remainder 0
-If the remainder is 0 then count is incremented else loop continues till the condition satisfies
-If the count is 2 the number is prime if not, not a prime
-As the prime number divides with one or itself where count becomes 2 then only its prime
